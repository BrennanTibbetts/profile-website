    description: `For the past 1.5 years, I’ve been working on a pilot-facing iOS application deployed to roughly 12,000 devices. I’ve helped lead the transition from =y=Objective-C=y= and =p=UIKit=p= to modern Swift-based development, working extensively with =p=SwiftUI=p=, =p=SwiftData=p=, and =p=Core Data=p=. I actively maintain the application, support crew members in the field, and manage deployments through a mobile device management platform to ensure reliable, secure releases at scale.

  My work spans both design and engineering. I create designs in =y=Figma=y= and implement fully featured solutions backed by microservice architectures, RESTful APIs, and modern =y=iOS=y= frameworks. In addition to my professional work, I’m currently developing a personal =y=iOS=y= application and look forward to sharing more about it soon.`

    title: "AWS Full Stack Development",
    subject: "MY AWS EXPERIENCE",
    description: `I work extensively with =y=AWS=y= to design, build, and deploy microservice-based systems. My experience includes developing and maintaining services backed by =p=AWS Lambda=p=, =p=API Gateway=p=, and =p=DynamoDB=p=, with a strong emphasis on scalability, reliability, and clean service boundaries. I regularly deploy and operate these microservices as part of an agile Scrum team, contributing across planning, implementation, and iteration.

  I’ve built end-to-end applications with microservice backends, primarily using =p=Node.js=p= and =y=TypeScript=y=, and have experience delivering frontend components with =p=React=p= when needed. My work focuses on creating well-structured, production-ready systems that integrate cleanly across the stack.`

    title: "3D Web Development",
    subject: "MY WEB DEV EXPERIENCE",
    description: `I build interactive, real-time 3D experiences for the web using =p=Three.js=p= and =p=React Three Fiber=p=, structuring scenes and logic with =p=React=p= (TSX and JSX). I’ve completed Bruno Simon’s =y=Three.js Journey course=y=, which gave me a strong foundation in modern =y=WebGL=y= workflows, performance considerations, and scene composition.

  I model assets in =y=Blender=y= and have a solid understanding of the graphics pipeline, including vertex and fragment shaders written in =y=GLSL=y=. I’m comfortable working close to the metal when needed, whether that’s custom shaders, low-level rendering decisions, or wiring everything together with =p=Node.js=p= tooling and build systems to ship interactive projects that actually feel responsive and intentional.`
